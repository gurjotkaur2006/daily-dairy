        <h2>Topics Covered:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>PHP Syntax - Explained with examples and code snippets to ensure better understanding.</li><li>PHP Variables - Explained with examples and code snippets to ensure better understanding.</li><li>PHP Echo & Print - Explained with examples and code snippets to ensure better understanding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>In-Depth Learning:</h2>
        <p>Each of the above concepts was taught using live demonstrations, and I practiced them using real code. The trainer ensured that doubts were clarified, and we used online platforms like W3Schools, PHP.net, and JSFiddle for testing snippets in real-time. This helped reinforce concepts visually and practically.</p>

        <h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>
        <p>Initially, I struggled with applying theoretical knowledge to practical coding problems. However, with continuous guidance, I was able to overcome these hurdles and gain more confidence in debugging code and implementing features step-by-step.</p>
