        <h1>Training Day 25 Report</h1>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 24 July 2025</p>

        <h2>Topics Covered:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Admin Module Authentication - Explained with examples and code snippets to ensure better understanding.</li><li>Transaction Management - Explained with examples and code snippets to ensure better understanding.</li><li>Project Security - Explained with examples and code snippets to ensure better understanding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>In-Depth Learning:</h2>
        <p>Each of the above concepts was taught using live demonstrations, and I practiced them using real code. The trainer ensured that doubts were clarified, and we used online platforms like W3Schools, PHP.net, and JSFiddle for testing snippets in real-time. This helped reinforce concepts visually and practically.</p>

        <h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>
        <p>Initially, I struggled with applying theoretical knowledge to practical coding problems. However, with continuous guidance, I was able to overcome these hurdles and gain more confidence in debugging code and implementing features step-by-step.</p>

        <h2>Project Work:</h2>
        <p> Improved the Contact section further by adding focus effects on input fields. Tested responsiveness and spacing at different breakpoints.</p>

        <h2>Implementation:</h2>
        <p>On Day 25, I cleaned up layout spacing: standardized margins and padding across sections, made sure visual hierarchy (which section stands out) is clear.</p>
        <h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>
        <ul>
            
        <li>Improved conceptual clarity through hands-on practice.</li>
        <li>Understood the real-world application of the topics in web development.</li>
        <li>Integrated learning with the ongoing codespark project.</li>
        <li>Facilitated independent problem-solving through daily coding exercises.</li>
    
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>Todayâ€™s session was not only informative but also practically useful. I was able to contribute to my project in a meaningful way, and I am seeing steady progress in both my theoretical understanding and coding ability.</p>
